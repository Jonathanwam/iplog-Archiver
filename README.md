# iplog Archiver

### This program takes iplog.txt which logs all activity on a web server then splits the file into seperate text files, one for each day.

### It is to be ran weekly. The process has been being completed manually which takes 1-2 hours. Now the bulk of the work is complete in less than 30 seconds.

### Instructions: 

1. Download the executable or compile the .go file
2. Make sure that the iplog.txt file and the executable are in the same folder. It will not work unless iplog.txt is exactly named iplog.txt
3. Launch the executable and wait 30 seconds.
